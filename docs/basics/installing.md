# Installation

The theme has not been published to `PyPi` so you need to install
from source.

## Get source

You can obtain the source from github:

~~~~
# copy source to local disk
git clone https://github.com/rab-dev/candy-mkdocs-theme
~~~~

## Install from source

To install from source run the `setup.py` command:

~~~~
cd candy-mkdocs-theme
py setup.py install
~~~~
